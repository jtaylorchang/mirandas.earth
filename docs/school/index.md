# School

I studied Earth, Society, and Environmental Sustainability with a certificate in Environmental Writing and a minor in Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I was one of 4 students to graduate with high distinction and I was the graduation speaker for my major.

You can read samples of my writing and publications from my time at the University of Illinois.
